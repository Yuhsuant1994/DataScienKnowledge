# Bag of words

In DS we tend to turn our data into matrices or tensors, like in image processing, 
however in NLP we need to turn words into numbers so we can stick them into the matrices

To start BOW we define the vocabulary we want to learn

|vocabulary|
|---|
|dataframe|
|colors|
|columns|
|plot|
|graph|

then we need to define some label to the topic
|possible labels|
|---|
|pandas|
|keras|
|matplotlib|

input `how to **plot** **dataframe** bar **graph**`
