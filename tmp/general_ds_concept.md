* What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning

[ref article](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/08/02/supervised-unsupervised-learning/#:~:text=In%20a%20supervised%20learning%20model,and%20patterns%20on%20its%20own.)

|Supervised |	Unsupervised|
|---|---|
|- Known result (feedback mechanism) <br>- Labeled input|- Unknown result <br>- Unlabeled input <br>- Like clustering, anomaly detection (bank fraud transaction), association (product recommendation) |


	
* How is logistic regression done?
[ref md](https://github.com/Yuhsuant1994/DataScienKnowledge/blob/master/REGRESSION/regression.md)

input -> f linear -> probabilities -> f sigmoid -> value close to 1/0 -> threshold classifier -> 1/0

25. Which of the following machine learning algorithms can be used for inputting missing values of both categorical and continuous variables?
K-means clustering
Linear regression 
K-NN (k-nearest neighbor)
Decision trees 
The K nearest neighbor algorithm can be used because it can 
compute the nearest neighbor and if it doesn't have a value, 
it just computes the nearest neighbor based on all the other features. 

When you're dealing with K-means clustering or linear regression, 
you need to do that in your pre-processing, otherwise, they'll crash. 
Decision trees also have the same problem, although there is some variance.
