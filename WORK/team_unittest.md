# 1. Global purpose of the project

Build a unittest for QA the data base tables quality and status to know if we can 
correctly run our projects based on those data. As well as the QA for projects result.

Then provide Dashboard for results and main table's KPI tracking. For internal tracking 
and external cross team communications.

PAIN POINT: Spent many times in debuging and finding the issue for the daily automation 
process. Many times the problem was reported from other team about the concern for our 
team data. 

IMPACT: **Reduce 80%** of the debug / communication and duplicated work.

TECHNOLOGY USED: Python, Unittest, Azure MSSQL, Redshift, PowerBI
