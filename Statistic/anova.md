one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA): 
 is an extension of independent two-samples t-test for comparing means in a situation where there are more than two groups

Null hypothesis: the means of the different groups are the same
Alternative hypothesis: At least one sample mean is not equal to the others.

we'll check the p-value to reject or not the null hypothesis


Check ANOVA assumptions: test validity?
The ANOVA test assumes that, the data are normally distributed and the variance across groups are homogeneous. We can check that with some diagnostic plots.
