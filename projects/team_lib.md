# 1. Global purpose of the project

We all first need to understand the data before all projects. while there are many 
tables that we used very often, we then try to avoid too much mistake and duplication 
work. By building the team library for often used functions, ETL process, data cleaning, 
model performing etc... It is a continuous process of building.

PAIN POINT: Duplication effort, error in small functions or ETL extraction filters etc...

IMPACT: Helped to slash team's yearly "Duplication of effort" survey score **from 76% to 24%**

TECHNOLOGY USED: Python, Azure MSSQL, Redshift
