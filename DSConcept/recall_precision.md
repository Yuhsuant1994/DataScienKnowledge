which one to focus on depending on what's the cost of false positive and
false negative.

* **Precision**: out of all the predicted positive how many of them is predicted true positive, 
reduce false positive. (when we predict it's positive it's not)
* **Recall**: out of all the real positive how many of them is predicted true positive.
reduce false negative (when we predict it's negative it's not)
* **F1 Score**: the weighted average of precision and recall. (take both matric into consideration)
